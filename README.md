# pyMax
Integration python OSC with MAX/MSP using UDPRECIEVE Object.
Conway's Game of Life generates new matrixctrl intended to generate synth.

To run open the osc1.maxpat
and then run the following in the terminal
python3 GOL.py

Current working on: 
-adding arguments to command so you can pick intial config to be random or
a common GOL pattern such as sliders or shooters
-having it read new states from the matrixctrl max object so that there can be a more 
interactive generation of states
